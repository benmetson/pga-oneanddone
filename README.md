# PGA One & Done — Preview UI (Clean)

This is a **zero-config** preview of the mobile-first UI.
- **No auth, no database, no env vars needed**
- All client components
- Deploys cleanly on Vercel

## Deploy on Vercel (2–3 mins)
1. Upload this folder as a new project (or push to GitHub and import).
2. Framework preset: **Next.js**
3. Leave env vars empty (optional: `PREVIEW_MODE=1`).
4. Deploy. Visit your *.vercel.app URL.

Once you're happy with the UI, we can add Supabase/Auth and real data.
